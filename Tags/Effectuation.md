Effectuation is a way of thinking and decision making that helps entrepreneurs start a business with the resources they already have, instead of waiting for the perfect plan or opportunity.

Entrepreneurs largely use an effectuation process. Which means they use
what they have = who they are + what they know + whom they know, and select possible outcomes.

### **Principles of Effectuation**
- The patchwork quilt principle - form partnerships
- The affordable loss principle - evaluate opportunities based on where the downside is acceptable, rather than on the attractiveness of the predicted upside.
- The bird in hand principle - start with your means (What you have available.) who you are + what you know + whom you know = what you have.
- The lemonade principle - leverage contingencies. Make the best out of threats and turn them into opportunities
- The pilot-in-the-plane principle - focus on activities within your control
